Seems like tough times are coming.","Conversation owner: I don't mind this place, but I wish it wasn't so close to the bounty office. Those guys are hired killers - I don't like it when they come in here for a drink.","Player: Your tricks don't fool me, Rulan!","Bastila: I can feel the power of the Force within you, old man, but I do not sense the taint of the dark side.

It would take an amazing racer to win me away.,"Player: Time for this to end, Bastila!",Czerka Patrol Guard: Czerka Corporation should burn down some trees. Make room for some swoop races.,"Vrook Lamar: You would do well to focus more closely on your lessons. The Force is strong with you, but you need training and guidance in the ways of the Jedi, lest you suffer a fate similar to that of Revan.","HK-47: Agreement: This was my thought as well, master. You show excellent logical skills... for a meatbag.","Conversation owner: If you have questions, you should direct them towards the Jedi Council members.","Hukta Jax: Yeah, you go then, and leave me alone.",Player: Why test me? Who have you done this for?,Hidden Bek: Brejik is nothing but a punk!

Yuka Laka: Of course it is, of course, but you must appreciate the finer things. Just take a look at the droid I have available. An HK-47.","Player: What's this? Love advice from an old Jedi?
Jolee: And why not? All this nonsense about avoiding love is so much foo-foo. I shouldn't be the only one who realizes that.","Player: I will race, and I will win.
Hukta Jax: Then you and Hukta Jax are gonna have problems, I promise you that. You was warned, fair and square.","Player: Perhaps you are right. You are safe... for now.
Komad Fortuna: There seems to be no reason for your anger, human. You would be wise to control it, lest it bury you.","Player: Sorry, I'll be going now.
Sith Trooper: Good. Get back to your patrol route. We need to keep a strong presence in the streets to maintain order here.","Player: It's nothing special.
Shaleena: Not to you, I suppose. But you're probably used to its beauty by now.","Player: No! This isn't the Bastila I knew!
Conversation owner: Of course not! I have been reborn in the wake of destiny... *your* destiny! The power of the dark side is yours by right!","Player: I just want to talk.
Juhani: Talk?! You who have beaten me so easily just want to talk? I do not believe it. Kill me now, while you still have the power.","Player: I don't know. Everything has changed, now.
Conversation owner: That's what I feared. Who's to say your old life won't come back... everything you felt and thought, all of it?","Mandalorian Mercenary: So the Sith smoked a Jedi outpost on Dantooine. No survivors, or so they say. First Taris, now Dantooine. Wouldn't surprise me if the Republic starts hiring mercs to make a counter attack.
Mandalorian Mercenary: They might even hire some Echani or Iridorian mercenaries, if they're desperate. I bet a Mandalorian could make some good money working for the Republic right now.","Player: [Computer] Gas room. (<CUSTOM32> spike(s))
Conversation owner: [SUCCESS] SWITCHING TO CAMERA.","Player: Who are you?
Daviktroop041: That's Canderous Ordo! He's the most famous Mandalorian mercenary in this sector of the galaxy!","Player: I remember you. Mekel, right?
Mekel: That's right. You might as well just go home, you know. There can only be one Sith this year, and that's me.","Player: I like this side of you, Bastila. Now we can truly be together.
Conversation owner: You think so, do you? You style yourself the Master of the Sith that you once were? To think I once envied you your passion, your power.","Player: Get out of my way.
Prospective Sith: Oh... uh, yes of course.","Player: [Lie] Yes, I'm sure they'll welcome you with open arms.
Rakatan Hologram: You must go now, Revan. The Star Forge feeds the power of your old apprentice. If you do not stop him soon he will become too powerful for even you to stop.","Shaelas: Human, you return. Have you information for me? Have you discovered the fate of the missing Selkath youth? Have you news of my daughter, Shasa?
Player: Not yet. I shall investigate further.","SithTrooper1: We found a disabled hunter-killer droid in the back of the ship.
SithCommander: Excellent. We can reprogram this droid to fight in our own army. Wipe its memory chip and take it to the salvage shop. The technicians will deal with it later.","Juhani: It seems I was mistaken... I should have known things could not change for me that easily.
Juhani: As it is the Council's wishes, I will accompany you. I will do my duty, and trust that you will do yours.","Player: And what does that have to do with you coming with me?
Jolee: Well, hey, the chances may not be great, but when one has the opportunity to see something like that twice in a lifetime...","Player: I did. It was... very interesting.
Motta the Hutt: Eh? You opened it but you're still around to deliver it to me? Impressive. More likely you're just lying, but I don't care.","Player: Hangar
Conversation owner: [You have to get to the bridge and unlock the docking bay doors before you go down to the hangar.]","Player: I'm sorry... I tried my best.
Rogue Assassin Droid: I... I would have liked to...","Player: Never mind. Goodbye.
Matton Dasol: All right then. Here, I should toss you a few credits for helping. I appreciate what you did.","Player: I agree.
Yuthura Ban: There is suffering and injustice in the universe. I am surprised the Jedi can even stand the stench of it, much less stand by and do nothing.","Player: I'll tell her when I see her.
Helena: See that you do. If Bastila is here, I can't see why she didn't come herself.","Player: [Persuade/Lie] You have to attack one of the Sith for it.

Conversation owner: Please, continue your investigations and find out what happened to our facility.","Belaya: [Failure] You do not fool me for a second! The Council fawns over you and places all their hope in you to save them... you wouldn't turn on them!
Belaya: You are a spy... and a murderer. It was you who killed Juhani and placed this bitter blackness in my heart that I cannot get rid of!","Bastila: I don't know. The vision of our future is clouded by shadows cast from the dark side. But I sense something ominous lurking in those shadows.
Bastila: But words alone cannot save one from the dark side. Come, we should continue with the task at hand. When the time comes I only hope we are all strong enough to do what we must.","Juhani: Yes we shall. I only hope that you will see this through until the end.
Juhani: Time will tell what choices you make. I shall stay by you to see this task done.","Bountyhunt023: Davik doesn't like witnesses.
Player: Leave this man alone or you'll have to deal with me!","Player: Answer my questions or I'll carve my initials in your skull with my blaster bolts!
Rodian: I mad now! See how you like me call guards! You die now!","Player: We are linked by more than just a bond, Bastila.
Bastila: Do not mistake the power of the Force for love, Revan. It does not exist. Power is what forged our bond, and power is what made us both tools of the Jedi Council!","Player: Tell me about this merchant Largo.
Zax: Actually, now that I think of it that bounty's no longer on the table. Davik told me Largo's bounty is off the table. I guess the merchant came up with the credits. Don't bother with that one anymore, human.","Player: What happened to the scientists?
Mercenary: They're dead! All dead! They swarmed out and over us. There was no way we could stop them.","Player: You disobeyed your orders?
Canderous: This is a chance given to a warrior once or twice in a lifetime. The chance to change the course of history in a single act.","Player: You see, Chuundar, there *is* someone. Uh... make it good, Zaalbar.
Chuundar: You are too quick to celebrate. Zaalbar talks of Freyyr, our father. Why, Zaalbar? He ordered you exiled when you attacked me.","Player: No one says you killed him... yet.
Handon Guld: I'm sorry, I'm... I'm getting a bit agitated. Why must we remain here? Can't... Can't you see that Rickard must have shot him?","Player: This is a public street!
Sith Soldier: Hiding behind the Selkath laws - typical Republic cowardice!","Suvam Tan: That was a good practice game. Interested in another?
Player: Let's play.","Juhani: But we are becoming too morbid too soon. We should not talk like this now. There is much yet we can do.
Juhani: But we shall talk later I am sure.","Player: I just have some questions. Don't bother getting friendly.
Gandroff: Uh, well, I wouldn't worry about that, not with your attitude. Go on then, ask away. I'm ready.","Ajuur: You lost last time, but maybe this time fortune will smile on you. I'll give you a you rematch and a chance to redeem yourself.
Player: Let's do it.","Player: [Persuade/Threat] Either tell me what's going on, or you can explain it to the Sith!
Zelka Forn: [Success] What? No! Don't tell the Sith. Please. I... I can explain all this.","Sith Diplomat: I can't believe you let that murderer Sunry go free! If the Selkath are so neutral and unbiased, why can't the Sith find any justice on this planet?
Sith Diplomat: But we Sith have long memories. Soon there will be a day of reckoning - very soon. So what are you doing here?","Player: If we get the opportunity... then I promise.
Carth: Thank you. I... guess there's really nothing else to say.","Motta the Hutt: [Failure] No, no I don't. What is this, a joke? Quit fooling around, I mean business.
Player: You give him a better deal or I bury you under your track!","Conversation owner: You? Why are you here? Haven't you done enough? Jaarak is dead and Rorworr is dead and... and...
Conversation owner: Just leave me alone. I don't want to talk to anyone.","Tanis Venn: But I suppose you would want me to do whatever they say. I heard how you rolled over for Gurke and his boys.
Tanis Venn: That's not the way to establish yourself, you know? It's hard to earn respect here.","Player: I need to make an NPC available to my party.
Cheat Bot: Which one?
Player: Bastila","Conversation owner: EMERGENCY FRONTLINE SUPPLY STATION PRESENT CZERKA CORPORATION RESOURCE ID FOR ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SUPPLY CONTAINERS.
Player: Use Czerka Resource ID to access supplies.
Conversation owner: IDENTIFICATION RECOGNIZED. ACCESS GRANTED. SELECT NEEDED SUPPLIES FROM RESOURCE CONTAINERS. STATION SHUTTING DOWN UNTIL RESTOCK.","Janice Nall: Oh... hello. Uh... welcome to my shop. Of course the Sith are always welcome here. Would you like to see my inventory?
Player: Let me see what you have for sale.
Janice Nall: Of course. Right away, your Sithness.","Player: [Persuade] That price is outrageous! I'll give you half.
Janice Nall: [Success] Half? If you're trying to rob me why not just stick a blaster in my face? On the other hand, I do want to stay on Davik's good side. Tell you what, he's yours for 1500.
Player: It's a deal.","Janice Nall: [Failure] What? I offer you a full refund and you want more? Business is tough enough as it is... you should be glad I'm giving you a refund at all!
Player: Fine... just give me the 50 credits.
Janice Nall: Glad to hear you're being reasonable. You have to understand that I'm trying to run a business here. Now, is there anything else you need?","Player: They are none of your business.
Sith Academy Guard: So long as the Sith do not object to them, neither will I. They will be your responsibility, of course.
Jolee: Aren't we always?","Disabled Sentry: This is an old, broken down bartender droid. It has been deactivated in preparation for disposal.
Player: Reactivate the droid. (1 repair part)
Disabled Sentry: [Failure] You don't have any repair parts. You leave the droid alone for now.","Player: He's probably already dead, Mission.
Mission: You heard the Czerka rep: the sandpeople sometimes take prisoners. Say what you want about Griff, but he's a survivor. I know he's still alive.
Mission: I can't make you go after my brother, but you're the only one who can save him. Just think about it, that's all I ask. In the end I know you'll do the right thing.","Yuka Laka: Well, normally I'd give a discount because I hear you are a swoop racer like my brother, but times are hard right now.
Yuka Laka: It's a very solid machine, in good shape. I can't let it go for less than 5000 credits.
Player: 5000 is steep, but I'll pay it.","Player: [Force Persuade] I don't need to pay the fee.
Sslamoth: [Success] Perhaps you don't need to pay the fee for this race. Yes, I think that is an acception we can make this one time.
Sslamoth: I'll warn you, though, I will not be able to offer this option again. My accounts are very closely monitored. Now, let's look at who you will be timed against.","Player: Quitter! Stand up for yourself!
Queedle: That won't work now, I think. You and all the other racers have outclassed me in every round. I just don't have the resources to compete.
Queedle: Maybe if I had been able to get my swoop upgraded... I don't know. It's too late now. It was fun while it lasted, but it's over. Goodbye.","Eli Gand: Of course. I am here to serve.
Player: Let me see what you carry.
Eli Gand: Yes, maybe I have something of interest. I know your tastes are fine. I recognize you as race champion of Manaan.","Player: I stop the attack. I will appear to be a hero.
Computer: But if nothing happens, your people will have no need of heroes. No, they don't see a threat. You have coddled them.
Computer: Your empire will be brought down by introspection. You have failed to match the pattern in memory.","Player: I don't have time for this! Gadon said you'd help me get inside the Vulkar base.
Mission: Listen, my friend Zaalbar is in serious trouble, so you can forget about me helping with anything else until I get him back!
Player: Fine - tell me what happened and I'll see if I can help you.","Player: What did they do to you?
Elder Warrior: They... they were trying to find out how to breach our defenses and gain entry to our camp... My comrades, they... they wouldn't tell them.
Elder Warrior: I'm sure that, had you not come, I would have ended up as they did.","Player: What do you know about the Hrakert Facility?
Republic Technician: I actually don't know much about it at all. It's some sort of facility the Republic built here wasn't it?
Republic Technician: I'm not really cleared for that sort of information...","Cand: Enough of this talk, Jagi! Let us do what we came here to do.
Player: Let's do it, Canderous.
Envirosuit dude3: And you shall all die!","Player: Sounds like Malak and the Sith have the right idea.
Conversation owner: How can you say that? The Sith are butchers! Soldiers, civilians - I mean, they don't care who they kill! Even...even children!
Conversation owner: Right now the Republic is the only thing keeping Malak's brutal fist from crushing the entire galaxy... and it won't be long until even the Republic falls to the Sith fleet.","Player: Could I get some information about the planet? I thought this was Kashyyyk.
Janos Wertka: That is what the dominant indigenous species calls this world, but maintaining this outpost grants Czerka Corporation naming rights in the trade guides.
Janos Wertka: But, I'm sorry, I really must insist that docking fees be paid before I impart any further services. I must follow proper procedure.","Loremaster Gjarshi: The One's troops captured a few of their scouts, but we could learn nothing intelligible from them. Attacks against their compound were fruitless and reaped terrible casualties.
Loremaster Gjarshi: We came here with near a thousand warriors... and you can see now what we are reduced to...
Loremaster Gjarshi: This is why the One thinks we need your help once again. You were able to enter the Elders' compound once before... perhaps you can again.","Conversation owner: Greetings, master. Please select the destination you wish to travel to. My database contains coordinates for the following locations on Taris:
Player: Upper Taris Northeast
Conversation owner: I will take you there right away.","Player: I can't afford that much.
Jergan: Well, I would like to help you but I can't arrange the meeting for free. And I'm afraid your feminine charms would have little effect on the Rodian bodyguards backstage.
Jergan: If you manage to come up with the credits just come back and see me. I'll be more than happy to arrange for you to meet the band. Until then, please enjoy the music.","Conversation owner: Hitting the buttons over and over again will not speed up your attacks and will not help you in combat! Combat uses a real-time, turn based system.
Conversation owner: Each character can only perform one action in each 3 second round. When a new round begins the character will perform the last command you selected.
Player: RESUME COMBAT","Player: Heard any rumors from off-planet?
Kudos: Nothing since that unfortunate business on Taris. The Republic is reeling from that, as are we all. It is troubling.
Kudos: But you can't let that call a stop to your day. We've survived worse, and will again. It's just the way things are.","Mechanic: What are you doing back here? You need to speak to the race announcer and get out on the track. The longer you wait the worse your nerves are going to get.
Player: Nerves? I'm not scared!
Mechanic: Good to hear. Go talk to the race announcer and he'll get you out on the track.","Mechanic: I really thought that last race was going to be the one, but looks like you'll have to go out again. But you better get the job done soon... that accelerator isn't doing too well.
Mechanic: It's still running with full power, but it's running way too hot for my liking. I've tried to rig up a cooling system to hold it together for another run or two. Beyond that though...
Mechanic: I'm not trying to put any extra pressure on you, but my gang's got a lot riding on this race. So bear down, focus and go get that time we need!","Vandar Tokare: Rahasia Sandral and Shen Matale have come here seeking shelter against their families. The Council has decided to give it to them.
Vandar Tokare: Their love for each other was being denied by overly possessive parents and we learned that it was only by your intervention that they managed to escape here.
Vandar Tokare: While it is regrettable that the fences between the families were not repaired, it is good that these two young lovers can live their lives free of oppression.","Player: You used me, Bastila! You're no better than the Sith!
Bastila: How can you say that? Malak nearly killed you, but the Jedi Council gave you another chance to live! They gave you a chance to redeem yourself by defeating the Sith!
Conversation owner: A rash and futile hope. The dark side is too strong, my power is too great! Even my old master is no longer a match for me!","Player: The other hunters say you shouldn't be trusted.
Gurke: What they say about us? Huh? Liars, every one of them.
Narkal: Yeah, they is just jealous of us and stuff. It's not our fault some of them die out in the dunes.","Player: Do you know anything about the young Selkath who have gone missing?
Mandalorian Mercenary: Not really. I have no interest in the Selkath other than the fact that they are charging me an exorbitant amount to stay on this world.
Mandalorian Mercenary: The Iridorian over there, however... He, I believe, may know more. He has been seen with several of them before.","Komad Fortuna: [Failure] Perhaps you are unfamiliar with how things work around here. The guards are always quick to act.
Player: Pay me or end up dead. It's that simple.
Komad Fortuna: No, things are never quite so black and white. I am protected here, as are you. Nothing will come of this.","Bastila: We got what we came for. There is no need to indulge your appetite for violence.
Player: I'll do what I want. Don't interfere.
Hudrow081: You core-slime! I didn't survive through all that torture just to let you kill me!","Player: 2500 credits then. I'll pay it.
Yuka Laka: Of course you will. It's practically robbery, since you threatened me to get the deal. I'll let this pass just so you leave.
Yuka Laka: I'll deactivate the restraining bolt on the droid when you tell it he's sold. After that, get out. Even if it lied about speaking a Sand People dialect, I'm still getting a horrible deal.","Sith Thug: [Failure] I hate whining! Let's shut them up!
Sith Thug Leader: I'm all for that! Come on!
Cand: Bring it on!","Yuthura Ban: You are too powerful. You would never be my second for long... if the academy even truly interested you.
Player: No, it never interested me. You were a fool... now you must die.
Yuthura Ban: I... I see. Then let us end this here.","Carth: Anyway... that's the story. For what it's worth.
Player: Thank you for telling me.
Carth: I've... never talked about it before. To anyone. I suppose it's time I finally did.","Decomissioned Droid: The droid is now active. It will attack any enemies that come in range.
Player: Program droid to ram storage room doors. (<CUSTOM45> repair part(s))
Decomissioned Droid: [Success] The droid moves off to carry out your instructions.","Player: What exactly is it about me that frustrates you?
Carth: Oh no, I'm not falling for that one. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Player: Really? It's hard to tell.","Player: We have other priorities, Carth.
Carth: You think I don't know that? I just... if there's a chance we can try to find him... I don't want to wait to track him down, if possible.
Carth: All this time I've thought he was... he must be a man by now...","Player: [Persuade] I just want a quick look around. Will 20 credits calm you down?
Vulkar Lab Guard: [Persuade] You give money? That sound good to me!
VulkLabTec02: If you take that money I'll tell Brejik you let a Bek spy bribe you!","Player: Chuundar has given me permission to be here.
Commander Dern: He's got no authority with me. I'm with Czerka Corporation. He's just some pet we keep so the locals stay in line.
Commander Dern: As long as you don't get in my way, you can wander where you want. I've got a job to do.","Player: I can't pay that amount either.
Motta the Hutt: If you don't have the confidence to win back the money you give me, why should I care if you race or not!
Motta the Hutt: Bah! Pay it or leave, that's the deal.","Player: [Force Persuade] Give me the deck.
Suvam Tan: [Success] Damn, I don't really need the money anyway. Here, take it.
Suvam Tan: Now I'll show you how to play.","Player: It recorded a very suspicious incident.
Matton Dasol: I really want to see this thing. This sounds very odd.
Eli Gand: You get excited over hearsay. There is no droid, no proof of anything. Get back to work.","Helena: You're back, I see. And Bastila isn't even with you.
Helena: I suppose she's too busy to even help her own mother, correct? Nothing more than I would expect from her after all this time.
Helena: Go on, leave me be. I will find the holocron myself, if I have to.","Player: That's okay - I never felt anything for you anyway.
Conversation owner: Oh, I thought... No, this is good. I'm glad you told me. This makes everything much easier.
Conversation owner: Don't worry - I can put this behind me. Let's just continue on with what we must do. It is better this way.","Matton Dasol: Here, take this. Thanks for reminding me about how he misused my trust. I'll make sure it never happens again. With anyone.
Juhani: You have taken a good and honest man and twisted him into a bitter, hateful creature. You must be so proud of yourself.
Bastila: Feeding this man's hatred is an act of malice and petty evil. The Council would not approve of your actions here, and neither do I.","Player: What does racing pay?
Nico Senvi: Motta has some basic incentives for good times, which you probably know, but this is just an amateur track.
Nico Senvi: The pro circuit is where the real credits are, but even that is hurting. I guess a lot of riders were on Taris.","Jolee: What was that? What's wrong? Did one of the Sith fighters hit us?
Carth: No, it's something else. We've flown into some kind of disruptor field. All my instruments are jammed... we've got massive overloads on all systems!
Carth: I'm picking up a single planet in this system. I'm gonna try and put us down there. Hold on - this might be a rough landing.","Hester: The mutants will kill him if you don't open the gate!
OutcastMan045: And if I open the gate they will kill us all!
Hester: No! You can't do this! It isn't fair!","Player: The kolto seems to have been contaminated.
Conversation owner: Contaminated? That's... That's much worse than I would ever have thought possible. It might have been better to lose the entire facility rather than damage the kolto supply.
Conversation owner: This must remain entirely secret. We cannot allow anyone to find out that we damaged the kolto production or we would be banned permanently from the planet.
Conversation owner: We can only hope that the damage that was caused will go away in time.","Player: What do you know about the Selkath?
Conversation owner: The Selkath are a species of secrets. They invite both the Sith and the Republic to their world, but welcome neither. They keep their true allegiance close to the vest.
Conversation owner: They hide their true numbers in great cities beneath the ocean that no off-worlder will ever see. They guard the secret of Kolto - where it is made, how it is made.
Conversation owner: The Selkath are a great mystery. To the Sith, to the Republic, to me... their secrets are what makes them strong. I would tell you more if I knew, but I do not.","Mika Dorin: People are saying the Kolto supply on Manaan has been destroyed. Of course when I heard the news I immediately thought of you, <FullName>.
Player: Why did you think of me?
Mika Dorin: Who else could have caused such a catastrophic change? You are a force of destiny, <FullName>. The galaxy is changed forever by even your slightest of actions.
Mika Dorin: But such actions have consequences, including drawing the attention of old enemies. You should probably look at my stock, <FullName>. It might come in useful in the coming battles.","Furko Nellis: Would you like to have another round of Pazaak?
Furko Nellis: However, you'll understand if we don't have any wagers. I... respect your ability too much to insult you by betting on you losing.
Player: All right, let's have a game.
Furko Nellis: Very good. Just for the sport of it. That's all I can afford.","Player: But... power without consideration of morality is a weakness.
Uthar Wynn: Ha ha ha! You are brave to argue, young one. I have met few students who would speak so openly to me.
Uthar Wynn: Ask yourself first what this 'morality' is? How is it created? Who does it benefit? Where do your notions of 'good' and 'evil' come from?
Uthar Wynn: You may come to the realization that morality is but an obstacle to overcome... or not. The discovery is yours to make, should you be ready.","Suvam Tan: Yeah, I have a few things kicking around the place. Stuff the Trandoshans and smugglers have brought for me to look at, and a few things I've been making from parts.
Suvam Tan: They aren't cheap, though. They pay a lot for what I can make, and anything I sell to you I can't exactly sell to them, now can I?
Suvam Tan: But if you're willing to pay, I've got a few of my more advanced things you can look at. I'm always working on more, so you can check back some other time if I don't have what you want right now.
Suvam Tan: Here, have a look.","Player: I'd like to ask about the Czerka Corporation.
Janos Wertka: Czerka Corporation has branches in many systems, mostly concerned with weapon production for personal and ship-mounted use.
Janos Wertka: Of course, the many outposts on this world are only concerned with bio-aquisitions.
Player: Bio-acquisitions? What do you mean?","Player: I've got more important things to worry about than remembering some janitor!
Janitor: Hmph! You'll change your tune the first time your plumbing breaks down and raw sewage floods your apartment. Then you'll be beggin' for Kadir to come help you out!
Carth: There's no need to antagonize the man. Besides... do you want to live in filth? I sure don't.
Janitor: We'll see who has the last laugh then! Now if you ain't going to be civil then I got work to do. This place doesn't clean itself, you know!","Player: Why do you need me for this?
Nilko Bwaas: I cannot trust anyone else. The Republic obviously wants to keep their secret - I have inquired often as to their purpose and been rebuffed.
Nilko Bwaas: The Sith cannot be trusted to give me an accurate report of events - they will twist the truth so that it furthers their own goals.
Nilko Bwaas: And the mercenaries are well aware of the high wages the Republic is paying - they would not report anything that might slow the flow of credits into their accounts.","Player: If you want my help you better make it worth my while.
Conversation owner: Oh, I get it. Never mind that the Sith will destroy the Republic and ravage the galaxy. You're only in this for the credits.
Conversation owner: Don't worry. The Republic pays its mercenaries well. You help me find Bastila and they'll make it more than worth your while, I'm sure. Plus, it might be your only chance to get off Taris.
Player: If it means getting off this planet, I guess I can help you find Bastila.","Player: I'll be going now.
Viglo: Oh... I get it. I get a little too forward and you want to hold it against me.
Viglo: Hey, I just thought of something! If I said you had a great body, would you hold it against me? Ha ha ha!
Viglo: Barkeep, I sense I've offended my lady friend. Bring me another round so I can drown my sorrows in the sweet nectar of the Selkath people.","Player: [Force Persuade] You fear me! Cower, little piggy!
Gurke: [Success] Wuh! Ah, we are sorry about everything! Yeah, everything! We'll leave now!
Narkal: They don't seem that scary to me, Gurke. You sure?
Gurke: Shut up and run, stupid! You want to die? Yeesh!","Player: Not even a Jedi? You mean not any more, right?
Jolee: Nope. Never was. Technically I never rose above the rank of Padawan, for various reasons. Does that surprise you?
Player: Not the way you describe your past, no.
Jolee: Heh. I suppose I'm not prone to live my life like most of the Jedi Masters do, that's true. My opinions on love are no different.","Juhani: Tatooine is a filthy desert. Planets such as this should not be fit for life at all. My skin itches just to be here.
Juhani: As you can see, it is a desert. Very little water. Too much sand. This sort of place attracts too much of the seedier side of civilization.
Juhani: As to the particulars of this world itself, I can safely say that it holds no interest for me, and I will be well pleased when we leave here and never return.
Juhani: Now is there something else, or may we hurry and do what we have to do here as quickly as possible?","Player: I don't actually care, one way or another.
Patrol Captain Dehno: Well... all right then. Carry on. We've work to do here.
Czerka Guard: Thanks for taking care of that, Captain.
Patrol Captain Dehno: You shut up. I'm not done with you two.","Player: I want to ask you a few questions.
Conversation owner: I am far too busy to spend my time conversing, human. I must reserve my time for paying customers, not idle gossip.
Player: I think I'll be going now.
Conversation owner: Until next time, human.","Cand: Nice speech. I bet you tell yourself that every night so you can sleep. But I accept who and what I am. I don't have to justify it with words - victory in battle is my justification!
Carth: Justification through victory? So what happens when you lose? You know, like you did against us.
Cand: You had us outnumbered five to one. You had more ships, more troops, more supplies and the Jedi on your side. And we still made the Republic tremble before we fell!
Carth: Nice speech. I bet you tell yourself that every night so you can sleep. I don't want to talk about this anymore, Canderous. The war is over. You lost.","Player: I don't have a deck.
VulkarMech03: No? That's a real shame. You can't play unless you have your own deck, and I don't know anywhere around here for you to get one.
Player: I guess I'll be going now.
VulkarMech03: Well, if you ever get your hands on a Pazaak deck and you're looking to play a few hands you know where to find me.","Player: None of your business, bug-eyes!
Suvam Tan: Eh? No need to be rude. I was just trying to be friendly is all... You don't have to bite my head off.
Suvam Tan: If you don't want to talk, then I don't really know what you're doing here. There's nothing really here in this end of space anymore.
Player: Anymore?","Handon Guld: When all of a sudden I heard a shot coming from over here. I ran over and found this man Calder lying on the ground dead!
Player: Did you see the killer?
Handon Guld: I saw Rickard come skulking out of the shadows of the rocks south of the river, and I knew something was wrong. I hit my emergency button and called the Enclave right away.
Handon Guld: Well... there, that's my story. Now please hurry this up and arrest Rickard so I can get on with my day!","Player: Who are you?
Elise: Oh, I'm sorry, master Jedi, I did not give you a proper introduction. I am Elise Montagne. I own the farm to the north of here.
Elise: But I really am in need of your assistance. Time may be critical with so many kath hounds about. Oh, and those Mandalorians! Please, will you help me find him?
Player: Alright, I will help you. Tell what happened.","Sith Soldier: Hold on - where do you think you're going? This area is restricted to Undercity patrols! Without the proper security papers I can't let you past.
Player: I've got my security papers right here.
Sith Soldier: Let me see... hmmm, these look to be in order. Okay, you can go down if you want. Can't say I envy you, though.
Sith Soldier: The Undercity is crawling with mutants. Rakghouls, they call 'em. If you see anything moving down there, shoot first and ask questions later.","HiddenBekCompGuard: Hey, you can't be in here right now - the control room is off limits! Don't you know there's a Vulkar assassin coming here to kill Gadon?
Player: Sorry, I didn't know. I'll be going now.
HiddenBekCompGuard: Wait a minute - how did you even get in here? Nobody's supposed to have the access codes to this door. Unless...
HiddenBekCompGuard: Assassin! Assassin in the base!","Canderous Ordo: I figured you'd be back. Neither one of us is getting off this planet unless we work together.
Canderous Ordo: Now, I know the Sith military base had a break in. I know it was you. I know you've got those departure codes I need.
Canderous Ordo: So what do you say? We join forces and I can get you inside Davik's base - and right to the Ebon Hawk. We can go right now.
Player: Sorry, I'm not interested.","Researcher Ll'awa: Yes, Revan? Is there anything I can help you with?
Player: I have found data on the genetic structure of your species.
Researcher Ll'awa: You... you have! Thank you! Thank you, Revan!
Researcher Ll'awa: This data will aid us greatly in our research.","Wookiee Guard: He will decide if you are fit to walk the village of Rwookrrorro. You've already soiled our world with what you brought on your ship.
Player: My ship? What do you mean by that?
Wookiee Guard: Chuundar sent us to search it. We found the exile. The nameless mad-claw, once called Zaalbar.
Player: Who gave you access? You had no right!","K-X12a Battle Droid: K-X12a Battle Droid Interface. Systems functioning normally. Slimeball Must Die subscript purged. Error: unit remains linked to other infected units.
Player: Playback: A special message from Marlena.
K-X12a Battle Droid: Having fun on the dunes, Tanis? I made sure you would. Here's the deal: Your precious droids have trapped you. They'll hold you until you die of thirst. Make a mistake while repairing them, they explode. Have a good death. My mother was right about you.
Player: Replay: A special message from Marlena.","Conversation owner: A small part of me has always regretted betraying you from afar. I always knew there were some who would think I acted out of fear, that I did not want to face you.
Conversation owner: But now fate has given me a second chance to prove myself. Once I defeat you in combat no one will question my claim to the Sith throne; my triumph will be complete!
Player: Your power is no match for the light!
Conversation owner: The Jedi Council were foolish to let you live. I won't make the same mistake. We shall finish this alone in the ancient Sith tradition: master versus apprentice, as it was meant to be!","Marl: Pretty impressive, Stranger. Ice is no pushover. People are starting to take notice of you. They say you're the best thing to come along since Twitch stepped into the ring.
Marl: If you're going to keep climbing the ranks, then I guess I'm next on your hit list, kid. I'm looking forward to it.
Player: Let's step into the ring, then!
Marl: You don't waste any time, do you? Go talk to Ajuur - he'll set the match up.","Selkath: Why are you disturbing me? Can you not see I am overseeing the packaging of this kolto?
Player: I just want to ask you questions.
Selkath: I have far more pressing matters than any questions you might have, off-worlder. This kolto is the backbone of Manaan's economy.
Selkath: You obviously are in the wrong place, off-worlder. I suggest you visit the courthouse west of here - there you may be of some use to the Selkath instead of a hinderance.","Prospective Sith Student: You... you were talking to Mekel! I saw you! Where did he go? D-did he... did he tell you I was worthy?!
Player: [Persuade] Mekel is tricking you. He'll never let you into the academy.
Prospective Sith Student: [Success] What?! I... I've wasted all this time! How could I have been so... foolish! I could have died!
Prospective Sith Student: I'll find another way in, I swear it! I'll show him! Thank you!","Dorak Quinn: Ah, one word though. Watch yourself around the Gamorreans. Gurke and his buddies aren't to be trusted.
Dorak Quinn: Everyone else I respect because they have skill. Those guys... they go for easier prey.
Player: What makes you say that?
Dorak Quinn: Just watch your back when you hunt. The dragons aren't the only dangers out there.","Shaleena: Well, I was born here for starters. My parents were Outcasts, banished to the Undercity for some crime or other... they never really liked to talk about it.
Shaleena: Everyone here is an Outcast... or the descendant of one. It's tough down here, but we survive. I guess it's easier for me, since I've never known anything different.
Shaleena: Some of the people have given up all hope; they've become bitter and depressed. But most of us are good people... despite what our ancestors may have done.
Shaleena: Gendar could probably tell you more. Or maybe Rukil. You could talk to them if you want.","Player: Get out of our way!
Envirosuit dude3: I have business with Canderous that does not concern you, Jedi.
Cand: This concerns my employer as well.
Envirosuit dude3: Employer? You've sunk that low, have you? So much for the vaunted Mandalorian honor you used to espouse.","Fodo Medoo: You've been beating me a lot lately... I don't know how much longer I can last against you.
Fodo Medoo: I don't really even have any more credits left to play... but if you want, I could put a few of my cards as my wager... You up for that?
Player: Sure, let's play.
Fodo Medoo: Let's see if I can't turn this around...","Player: Your droid escaped and is nowhere to be found. He's still out there somewhere.
Elise: He is out there still? I must find him!
Mission: Hey, why'd you have to do that? That was just mean!
Zaalbar: Your actions disturb me. Among my kind, those who take pleasure in the suffering of others are considered dangerously unstable.","Player: [Computer] Open hangar bay doors. (<CUSTOM34> spike(s))
Conversation owner: [FAILURE] ACCESS DENIED! SPIKES REJECTED HANGAR DOORS CAN ONLY BE OPENED FROM BRIDGE ENTER COMMAND
Player: Log out.
Conversation owner: EXITING SYSTEM...","Bastila: Now I think I understand. This map was only the starting point for Revan's dark journey into the ways of the Sith.
Bastila: Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Manaan, Korriban: Revan visited each of these worlds searching for clues to reveal the hidden location of the Star Forge.
Player: So now what?
Bastila: Before we do anything we must inform the council of what we have discovered. They will decide our next course of action, though I suspect our task has only just begun.","Player: How do I know this isn't some kind of trick?
Rogue Assassin Droid: I can offer you no assurances, sentient. All is as it seems. If you cannot believe my statements, then combat is the inevitable result.
Player: You... appreciate the value of life?
Rogue Assassin Droid: You do not? All beings are constructs of fascinating complexity. An enlightened being rises above the need for destruction, no matter its nature.","Jolee: Malak is a tyrant who should be stopped. If he conquers the galaxy we're in for a couple of rough centuries. Eventually it'll come around again, but I'd rather not wait that long.
Jolee: So we do what we have to do, and we try to stop the Sith. But don't start thinking this war - your war - is more important than any other war just because you're in it.
Carth: That's an interesting theory, but I don't buy it. The Republic stands for something; it's stood for something for fifteen thousand years. And if it falls, everything will change forever.
Jolee: You believe whatever you need to to get you through this, sonny. The bottom line is we both want to stop Malak, so let's not get hung up on the details. Let's just get back to stopping him.","Player: I have found the body of the Jedi Nemo. He was slain by kath hounds.
Vrook Lamar: Ah, Nemo. He was a brave and honorable man. He had great strength with the Force.
Player: His strength was not enough...
Vrook Lamar: But remember your task, Padawan!","Sarna: Hey, you made it! I was beginning to wonder if you were going to show! The party's in full swing - come on in.
Sarna: You have to try this Tarisian ale - it's fantastic! We should have conquered this planet ages ago!
YunGenda021: Careful, Sarna. That wine's got quite the kick. A couple more bottles and we'll all be passed out on the floor!
Sarna: Who cares? We're not on duty tomorrow - let's live a little! Come on - drink up!","Suvam Tan: Those Trandoshan scum! They couldn't get more out of me, so they tried to kill me instead!
Suvam Tan: Hopefully, I'll have time before they send someone else to investigate... maybe rig their ship to take off somewhere else...
Suvam Tan: Thank you for your help, at least. I know I couldn't have taken them on my own.
Suvam Tan: I'll let you look at my special stash. It's the stuff I wasn't showing them. It won't be cheap, but if you want it, you can buy it.","Player: I will help you with this, Rukil.
Rukil: Finding her may be difficult; Malya could be anywhere in the Undercity... but if you find her I will know you to be our true savior! Only then can I reveal my secret knowledge to you.
Player: I'll be back if I find anything out.
Rukil: I wish you luck, up-worlder. Come speak to me again once you have discovered the fate of my apprentice.","Player: We should get back to the task at hand.
Mission: Yeah, I suppose you're right. Like I used to tell my brother, fast talk and slick words don't get the job done.
Player: I didn't know you had a brother.
Mission: My brother's a touchy subject, you know? It just so happens I don't really feel like talking about him right now. Nothing personal. Let's just get back to the business at hand, okay?","Player: Let's just say you came up a little short of my expectations.
Slave: Please, I beg you - don't tell Davik you are displeased with me! He punishes those slaves who do not satisfy his guests!
Player: I won't say anything if you answer my questions!
Slave: I have no wish to be beaten by Davik, so I will tell you all I know. I hope it is enough to buy your mercy.","Player: I can't just let you out. This whole place would turn on me.
Mission: We'd be risking everything just to get you out! That doesn't bother you?
Griff: You can't abandon me here. These Sand People, they're animals.
Player: Run to Anchorhead. They'll be too busy fighting me to operate the turrets.","Marl: If you're looking for excitement the duel rings here are your best bet. Stay out of the Lower City - it's nothing but a gang ridden slum. Is there anything else you want to know?
Player: Tell me more about these duels.
Marl: The duels themselves are simple enough. Two combatants armed with stun pistols enter the ring. One walks out a winner, the other is carried out unconscious on a stretcher.
Marl: If you're interested in setting up a match - or if you want to place a wager - just go speak to Ajuur. He's that Hutt over in the corner. He'll make all the arrangements.","Player: Aren't you Carth Onasi's son?
Dustil Onasi: No, I'm not. I don't know who you're talking about.
Player: Are you sure...?
Dustil Onasi: Look... I don't want to hear that name ever again. Ever. You understanding me? Now get lost.","Player: [Force Persuade] You know you need to pay me.
Yuka Rill: [Success] I know I need to pay you. It's obvious my old loans have caught up to me. I knew it would happen.
Cand: *whisper* I'm amazed at how many people that works on. The entire galaxy must be filled with weak-minded fools.
Bastila: *whisper* The Force should not be used for profit and personal gain. As Jedi we should be above such things.","Cand: What was that all about? Are you going soft on me?
Carth: I'm glad to see we're still the good guys here. Sometimes I think we forget that.
Zaalbar: I am proud to call you my friend, <FullName>. You have a noble and generous spirit.
Mission: Wow, sometimes helping people feels pretty good, you know?
Juhani: This is how we Jedi should always act: with honor.","Player: What happens if I make a mistake?
Rogue Assassin Droid: If you shut down a system out of the proper order, a shutdown will occur. You must use your skill to re-initialize the sequence... or I will attack.
Player: How hard is it to re-initialize the sequence?
Rogue Assassin Droid: It is not difficult. It will get more difficult, however, the more times that you make an error.
Player: What systems do you have?","Player: Your construction woke something up.
Conversation owner: Something was down there? Living in the Rift by the kolto?
Player: A gigantic firaxan shark that drove all the Selkath insane.
Conversation owner: That's... horrible. The entire operation wasted by a disaster we could never in a thousand years have foreseen.
Conversation owner: What has happened to the facility itself? Were there any survivors?","Player: To stop them from learning about the secret base by the Hrakert Rift.
Judge Shelkar: It is good that you are looking out for the joint interests of the Republic and Manaan in this issue, but was is really necessary to take such extreme measures?
Player: They had almost found out about the station.
Judge Kota: The secret must be kept from the Sith, no matter the cost!
Judge Shelkar: Indeed. We will adjourn to discuss the situation and the charges brought against you.","Commander Dern: I'd feel guilty if the money weren't so good. Come back here when you've got the glands and I'll pay you.
Player: Back to my general questions, all right?
Commander Dern: Hurry up. You're eating into my profits.
Player: I've got a tach gland to sell you.
Commander Dern: I'll take whatever you have. Keep it up and we'll both be rich. At least until we bleed this planet dry, hahaha!","Ancient Droid: You are neither Builder nor slave. If you seek the secrets of the Star Forge you must first prove yourself worthy. Only then will the sealed door behind be opened.
Player: I want to ask you some questions.
Ancient Droid: I am here to aid those who seek the knowledge of the Builders. What do you wish to know?
Player: Who are you again?
Ancient Droid: I am the Overseer. The Builders programmed me to enforce discipline among the slaves while this monument to the power of the Star Forge was constructed.","Shaardan: Oh-ho! If it isn't the freak from the colony. Hello, freak.
Player: Who are you?
Shaardan: Shaardan's the name. Don't forget it. You'll have me to thank when you get kicked out of here.
Player: Get lost, nerf-herder.
Shaardan: You'll get yours. Just you wait.","Protocol Officer: That... may help in this instance. Let me think... perhaps I remember this Griff character.
Protocol Officer: We hired that Twi'lek some time ago. Not a good worker according to his crew chief: always complaining and faking injuries to get out of work.
Protocol Officer: He entered false time sheets and slept through his shifts. We even suspected him of stealing Czerka Corporation supplies, although we could never prove it.
Player: Yes, that sounds like him.
Protocol Officer: We would've fired him but we needed workers. It would have been better for him if he had been fired. Then the Sand People wouldn't have gotten him.","Player: So you aren't a Sith?
Adrenas: No, not truly. I serve the Sith, but I do not study and train in the Force as you do.
Player: Can I ask you some questions?
Adrenas: I am sure there is nothing I can help you with. I am only a servant to the academy.
Player: How come you don't speak Galactic Basic?","Zelka021: I see from your appearance that you are an off-worlder. Still, you are welcome here. I'll not have it said that Zelka Forn refused to help somebody just because they weren't a citizen of Taris.
Zelka021: Do you require healing or medical supplies? I can treat almost any injury or ailment right here at the medical facility, except the rakghoul disease, of course.
Player: Rakghoul disease? What's that?
Zelka021: The terrible affliction has plagued Taris for many generations. It is spread by the rakghouls, horrible monsters that live in the Undercity below Taris' great skyscrapers.
Zelka021: Prolonged exposure to the Undercity breeds the disease and those infected will eventually mutate into rakghouls themselves, becoming mindless beasts that feed on the flesh of others.","Player: I'm unsure what Zaalbar would say. I would accuse him to be safe.
Mission: Come on, you know you could trust Big Z! He'd never turn on you.
Computer: The temperment of a companion is unreliable at best. You wisely trade the threat of one year or five, for none or two.
Zaalbar: I don't like this machine, or the answers it coaxes.
Computer: In this instance, the Wookiee is unreliable. His family has been a mire of treachery. I judge the answer correct.","Nurik Sandral: I knew you were lying, you dog! And to think I thought it might not have been you! So I'll take your son from you!
Rahasia Sandral: Father, no! Don't do it!
Nurik Sandral: Die!
Ahlan Matale: Shen!
Player: Stop this madness now!","Rusted Droid: The droid is now active. It will attack any enemies that come in range.
Player: Optimize droid's weaponry. (<CUSTOM42> repair part(s))
Rusted Droid: [Success] The droid is now set for maximum firepower.
Player: Optimize droid's targeting systems. (<CUSTOM43> repair part(s))
Rusted Droid: [Success] The droid is now set for maximum accuracy.","Twitch: Ready Aim Fire!! Is your trigger finger as itchy as mine?
Player: What the hell are you talking about?
Twitch: Shoot first! Shoot last! Party with me, we'll have a blast!
Player: Uh... okay. Goodbye then.
Twitch: Blast away! Open fire! Shoot, kill, maim!","Player: What do you know about Fazza's lodge?
Gate Guard Billan: Fazza's is north of the Czerka office. You'll need a hunting license to deal with him. He'll just send you to the Czerka office to get one.
Player: [Persuade] If it's my risk, why not just let me pass?
Gate Guard Billan: [Success] You know, I agree with you, but Czerka Corporation just doesn't want the headache.
Gate Guard Billan: Besides, I couldn't let you pass if I wanted to. The gate lock needs to be swiped with your authorization. Sorry.","Sasha: Sasha na esowon in bristag. Bristag me laesfa.
Player: Lur Arka na bads. Nuh-gisen laesfa, Sasha.
Sasha: Laesfa? Me palkie laesfa?
Sasha: Yb, bristag. Yb-abu, <FirstName>!
Lur Arka Sulas: Thank you for your assistance, sentient. I am sure the girl's parents will be most appreciative of your efforts.","Admiral Saul Karath: Lord Malak, the Star Forge is operating at 200% capacity - far beyond our expectations.
Darth Malak: I am more interested in the young Jedi Bastila and her Battle Meditation. Have you learned how she escaped the destruction of Taris?
Admiral Saul Karath: She was aided by Carth Onasi, a decorated war hero of the Republic and a legendary soldier. During the Mandalore Wars he was honored many times for his bravery.
Darth Malak: You know this man?
Admiral Saul Karath: Yes, Lord Malak. He served under me when I still followed the Republic. You could say I was his mentor.","Player: Why not just let me die?
Bastila: The Jedi hold all life sacred, even that of a Sith Lord. I could not just let you die, Revan. Not if it was possible to save you.
DarthMalak400: Bastila hides the truth behind noble words, Revan! The Jedi needed the memories buried deep in your wounded mind; there was no other way to bring them out. They had to keep you alive!
Player: But why program me with another identity?
Bastila: We couldn't simply restore your true identity; Revan was too dangerous. But locked inside your mind was information the Republic needed: the secrets of the Star Forge.","Rakatan Hologram: The time has come for you to atone for your past crimes, Revan. But the task ahead will be difficult. Those you call dark Jedi - followers of your old apprentice - now dwell within the Temple.
Player: There's dark Jedi inside the Temple? How did they get in there?
Rakatan Hologram: The last time you and Malak entered the Temple you must have found the controls to raise and lower the shields. Those inside can lower the barrier to allow other Force users to enter and exit the Temple.
Rakatan Hologram: But they will not be able to prevent us from using the ritual to gain you access. Once inside, however, we can do nothing to help you.
Rakatan Hologram: Go to the Temple now. We will meet you there once the ritual has been prepared. Remember: in accordance with ancient Rakata tradition you must enter the Temple alone.","HK-47: Answer: You may attempt to restore portions of my deleted memory, master, but some skill at repair is required.
HK-47: The deeper functions of my core memory, however, would still be unadvisable to tamper with.
HK-47: Conjecture: It is possible that some external stimulus might result in the memory core being reactivated... but I am unaware of any program existence to do so.
Player: So you're saying that your memory might just... come back?
HK-47: Conjecture: There may be hidden programming that awaits certain conditions to reactivate my memory core, master... but there is no way to know.","Wookiee: Freyyr is returned to us! The madness of Chuundar will be undone. It is a great day, and I'm told it is becasue of you, <FullName>.
Wookiee: And you, Zaalbar, you fought for us even when shunned. All of Rwookrrorro is grateful, and also shamed for the way you were treated.
Zaalbar: I am proud of today. Yesterday is forgotten.
Player: I need to ask you some questions.
Wookiee: I will answer if I can.","Yuthura Ban: Ahhh. How very clever of him. Normally you would face some other student in the tomb, preferably one of the failed ones.
Yuthura Ban: Obviously Uthar has decided to get rid of me. But why...? Did you say something to him?
Player: Yes, I did.
Yuthura Ban: What?! You fool! While I respect your attempt to play both sides of the fence, you are playing a dangerous game.
Yuthura Ban: If you think Uthar will truly be so grateful to you for double-crossing me, think again. Your only chance lies with me.","Lurze Kesh: Wait a minute... don't you work for Davik? Just how is it you happen to be flying the Ebon Hawk, anyway?
Player: Davik's dead, I presume. I stole the Ebon Hawk from him.
Lurze Kesh: Well, when a planet explodes, you've got to expect a few changes. Davik's dead, hey? Maybe you can still help me with something.
Lurze Kesh: We had arranged for several kilograms of spice to be shipped to us here aboard the Ebon Hawk. Perhaps Davik left it on board?
Lurze Kesh: I suspect if it is, it would be in the container we gave him. Locked and requiring a code. Might you have seen such a thing, human?","Player: Whoa, guess I touched a nerve there, huh?
Bastila: Touched a nerve, no. Getting on my nerves, most definitely. I suppose this is what you men consider being witty. *sigh*
Bastila: Now, are you going to answer my questions? Or would you rather just keep annoying me?
Player: Okay, I'll answer a few questions.
Bastila: Don't worry, these are simple questions. Nothing too intrusive. First, what kind of background do you have?","Matrik: I've already thought of that. I even came up with a plan of how to do it. But I can't pull it off while I'm holed up in here.
Player: Tell me your plan and I might help you out.
Matrik: The trick is getting Davik to buy it when there's no body found at the scene. If it looks like I died in a massive explosion, he won't be suspicious when my corpse never turns up.
Matrik: If I had an accomplice go back and tell Davik that they were the one who set off the explosion to eliminate me, I think I'd be home free.
Matrik: I have some demolitions experience from my own days in the Exchange so I could set it all up. But I'd need to get my hands on a permacrete detonator.","Intelligence Officer: So you're the one Roland has got to help us interrogate this prisoner. I hope your Jedi powers will come in useful, this one has been most resistant.
Intelligence Officer: He's a Sith spy we picked up a little while ago snooping around outside trying to get in. We thought he was suspicious and brought him inside when the Selkath weren't looking.
Intelligence Officer: But it seems the Sith have done a pretty good job of conditioning this guy, and we haven't been able to break him yet.
Player: What did they do to him?
Intelligence Officer: The Sith protect their really important spies with some sort of mental Force feedback system. They can turn their minds in on themselves so Force compulsions won't affect them.","Player: And I am Darth Revan! You will listen to me, Chuundar.
Chuundar: You expect me to believe that, <FullName>? Even here on Kashyyyk we have heard the tale of how the Lord of the Sith was killed by the Jedi.
Player: [Persuade] I wasn't killed, I was only captured. Now Revan has returned - and you don't want to get on my bad side!
Chuundar: [Success] There is something strange about you... a darkness I can smell in your scent. Maybe you are one of the Sith. Maybe you are even Darth Revan, as you claim.
Chuundar: But what do I care about Sith and Jedi? Czerka are the only outsiders here on Kashyyyk. And the mighty Chuundar does not bow down, even to them!","Canderous: I still remember that final battle in the skies above Malachor V. The two fleets filling the space around it, outshining the stars...
Player: But you eventually lost.
Canderous: Yeah, we lost. But there is no shame in it. We lost to the greatest single warrior the Republic has ever known.
Canderous: It was not your ships or your men or your vaunted 'fight for freedom' that won this, the final battle of the war.
Canderous: It was by the actions of one person, the Jedi Revan, that you prevailed.","Player: My loyalty is as true as Carth's!
Saul Karath: It is time to put your loyalty to the test. I doubt torturing you will gain me your true cooperation. Your will is too strong to be broken that way.
Saul Karath: However, even the strongest of heroes has trouble watching those they care about suffering.
Saul Karath: The interrogation will begin now. Each time you refuse to answer or give me a false answer, Bastila will suffer.
Player: Don't hurt her, I beg you.","Player: Why were you out here?
Rickard Lusoff: I told ya already, didn't I? Was hunting some iriaz. Haven't seen many in the area recently, what with those kath hounds acting up, but they're still around.
Rickard Lusoff: Was in my blind a little south of here when I spotted one, like I said before. I shot and POW!, it went down. But when I come over here, there's Handon standing over the body and the iriaz was gone!
Rickard Lusoff: Now, I didn't have nothing to do with this, so can I go now?
Player: Not just yet.","HK-47: Answer: No, master. You never did make me privy to any of the Star Forge's secrets.
Player: What can you tell me of Malak?
HK-47: Commentary: Your former pupil is efficient and brutal, even for an organic. I rather liked him when you first introduced me to him.
HK-47: If I had known what he would do to you, master, I would have gladly removed his entrails right then!
Player: So... why the 'meatbag' references?","Judge Naleshekan: I find that highly unlikely, Arbiter. The Sith have no need of such deception. The facts speak clear.
Judge Jhosa: But the Sith have been known for violence, deception, and murder before.
Judge Shelkar: That is also true. Is there another point you would make?
Player: My arguments are complete.
Judge Shelkar: Then the court will now deliberate amongst ourselves.","Republic Soldier: Yeah, what do you...? Oh, I apologize Master Jedi, I should not have been rude.
Player: It is alright.
Republic Soldier: No really, I should apologize. I should try to control myself... as you Jedi do.
Republic Soldier: Is there anything I can help you with?
Player: Why do the Sith upset you so much?","Player: Are there any pro racers here?
Motta the Hutt: There aren't a lot of pro racers *anywhere* with Taris gone. I'm going to try and build up one or two of my own.
Motta the Hutt: But, I suppose there are a couple of pros here. Some ""has-been"" and ""never-were"" types. That sort of thing.
Motta the Hutt: Zoriis Bafka is the best of the lot, outside my local champ Nico. Most racers in her league never stop here.
Player: Let's go back to my other questions.","Carth: Why did you do that?! It's not like we're badly in need of credits, for crying out loud.
Bastila: This is beneath even you, stealing from a helpless woman. How could you?!
Juhani: You should not act this way. You are treading a dangerous path I fear.
Jolee: My, my. You should be proud of yourself, outwitting her like that.
Cand: Back off, old man. I thought you were the non-involved type, remember?","Sarna: Okay, you've got a deal. The trick is to get you the uniforms without the Sith knowing I gave them to you. But I've got a plan.
Sarna: I'm going to a party with some of the other Sith soldiers tonight. You show up and I'll make sure everyone else gets good and drunk. When we pass out you can take our uniforms.
Player: Won't you get in trouble if I steal your uniform?
Sarna: I'll probably get a reprimand for not locking it up, but that's about it. Then, in another month I'll resign and retire with all those credits you gave me.
Sarna: Here - I'll add the address of the party to your datapad. Show up there later. To be on the safe side we shouldn't speak again before or after the party.","Player: Is there no cure?
Zelka021: There is no antidote for the disease, though I heard the Republic scientists at the military base here on Taris were close to perfecting a cure. Then the Sith arrived.
Zelka021: They overran the military base and now they refuse to allow anyone access to the laboratories inside. The Sith are keeping all the serum for the patrols they send into the Undercity.
Zelka021: If I could just get my hands on a sample of that serum the rakghoul disease could be wiped from the face of Taris forever. But I don't see how that's going to happen.
Player: Maybe I could find a way to get my hands on that serum for you.","Conversation owner: But the Genoharadan did not disband. Instead, we vanished into the darkness. Now we carry on our work from the deepest shadows, dispatching the enemies of those who hire us.
Player: Tell me more about the Genoharadan.
Conversation owner: In the first few centuries after Xim was overthrown, the Genoharadan were nothing but hired killers. We were a mere tool to be used by those who were rich and politically ambitious
Conversation owner: But slowly the guild evolved. We began to shape and alter events through our actions. We ceased to be a servant of the political elite; we became a powerful faction in our own right.
Conversation owner: The organizaton of the guild itself also changed at this point. Instead of a single guildmaster, it was decided there would be four Overseers to guide and lead the Genoharadan.","Uthar Wynn: So you return to us with the lightsaber in hand, as I knew you would.
Yuthura Ban: The Force has served you well.
Uthar Wynn: You took a great risk in acquiring the artifact. You used your mind and your power... no peaceful meditation, no pacifism.
Uthar Wynn: Sometimes you must fight in order to achieve. This gives you your passion, this makes you stronger. This is what makes you superior.
Uthar Wynn: That is the lesson we teach with that part of the final test. Do you understand?","Player: Alright. Let's begin.
Rogue Assassin Droid: Very good. What would you like to shut down first?
Player: Cognitive Systems
Rogue Assassin Droid: (zzzt!) All systems reset. I am sorry; that is not correct. If you do not re-intialize shut down immediately, I will become violent. Please accept my apologies.
Player: [Repair] Try to re-initialize the shut down sequence.","Dayso Cooh: I suppose you could take them off of the warrior raiders in the Dune Sea, but there's no way I'd survive anything like that.
Dayso Cooh: Plus you would have to explain why you killed their warriors if you are trying to make peace... but I suppose there is no other way.
Player: Maybe I'll look into it.
Dayso Cooh: Sure, that's what Czerka Corporation keeps saying, and then they just start shooting again. The fighting won't stop until they are all dead.
Dayso Cooh: Or until the Czerka leave. The one is as likely as the other with the way things are going. Bah, what do I know.","Jolee: Why they did I... I will never truly know. But they did. Battle broke out throughout the order... pupil against master, we fought ourselves...
Player: That must have been difficult.
Jolee: Yes. More than difficult... next to impossible. How do you fight against someone you love?
Jolee: Bah. I dislike such memories. It leaves a taste in the mouth that... it is a sadness I thought I had put aside long ago.
Jolee: Ask me again about the war some other time. Just... not now. I would prefer to be by myself for now.","Gurke: *snort* What do you want, dragon-killer? Gurke and the boys don't have time for you. We are big hunters too.
Narkal: Yeah, you nothing. *squee*
Player: I wanted to ask questions about you and hunting.
Gurke: Go reads a book or get a yappy droid. Gurke and the boys don't train babies.
Narkal: Yeah, we hunt the wraid best out of everybody. We don't have time to train you or anyone.","Player: What are the Hidden Beks planning?
Alien Prisoner: You would have to ask Gadon Thek to know the answer to that question. They approached me, and my only role was to obtain the Sith uniforms for them.
Player: Can you take me to Gadon?
Alien Prisoner: Access to the Lower City is restricted, I have never actually met Gadon. My only dealings were with members of his Hidden Bek gang.
Player: Can I get one of those uniforms from you?","Loremaster Gjarshi: Nor do the gods in the sky listen to our pleas any longer, although we can still see their lights gleam in the heavens.
Loremaster Gjarshi: So we mortal Rakata are left here to our own devices... to make the future we demand for ourselves.
Player: Tell me of your first civilizations.
Loremaster Gjarshi: Back in the days of the first awakening, when our people rose from the ground and brought the light of civilization to our new world, our people spread far and wide across all the islands.
Loremaster Gjarshi: Among these peoples, there were some that rose to greatness on the largest islands. Rakatans of vision and forethought who built great monuments to themselves and their leaders.","Nurik Sandral: Rahasia! You will not leave with this... this Matale boy!
Rahasia Sandral: I am, father, and you can't stop me! We're leaving for the Enclave!
Nurik Sandral: You foolish girl!
Player: Do not try to force them to return.
Ahlan Matale: You expect us to just let them leave?? Droids! Stop them!","Player: How could you possibly help me?
Carth: Whatever's happened up until this point, there's going to come a time very soon where you're going to have to make a choice. And there won't be any turning back.
Carth: I want you to make the right choice. I want to give you a reason to.
Player: And if I make the wrong choice?
Carth: Well then I hope I can save you. From yourself.","Bastila: Darth Malak!
Carth: Down you go!
DarthMalak400: Ha-ha-ha!
DarthMalak400: I hope you weren't thinking of leaving so soon, Bastila. I've spent far too much energy hunting down you and your companions to let you get away from me now.
DarthMalak400: Besides, I had to see for myself if it was true. Even now I can hardly believe my eyes... tell me, why did the Jedi spare you? Is it vengeance you seek at this reunion?","Hulas: I am not surprised to see you here, <FullName>. I am surprised you came alone, however. I thought you would know by now how dangerous we Genoharadan are.
Player: I knew you were too much of a coward to come alone!
Hulas: Really? If you knew this, you should have been smart enough to bring your friends with you. You helped me betray the other Overseers: you should know I don't play fair.
Player: I honored our agreement. This is between you and me alone.
Hulas: You have seen me betray the other Overseers, yet you still believe a Genoharadan cares anything about honor? That is a foolish mistake, <FullName>. One you won't live to regret.","Researcher Ll'awa: Genetic data on drifts and changes over the many millenia we have been here. Specific data on exceptional individuals.
Researcher Ll'awa: If only we had access to the knowledge of our ancestors... They must have known much, much more than us. They had a much greater population sample to work with.
Researcher Ll'awa: I believe that in the Temple there may be the information we seek. Perhaps in old archives or scrolls... maybe even in an ancient computer if any is still functioning.
Researcher Ll'awa: This information would help us greatly in our work, and we would be very grateful to you for it.
Researcher Ll'awa: Is there anything else I can help you with?",mean_time_cost,mean_gpu_cost
